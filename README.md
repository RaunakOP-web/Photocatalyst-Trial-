# Glycerol Photocatalyst HER Prediction

## Overview

Machine learning pipeline to **predict and rank photocatalysts** for hydrogen
evolution via glycerol photoreforming. Trains XGBoost and LightGBM regressors on
an 886-row literature-mined dataset, using physically meaningful features to
predict the hydrogen evolution rate (HER, µmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹).

## Setup

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/RaunakOP-web/Photocatalyst-Trial-.git
cd Photocatalyst-Trial-

# Create a virtual environment (recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Linux/macOS
.venv\Scripts\activate      # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage — Step by Step

### Step 1: Add your dataset

Drop your master dataset (CSV, JSON, or XLSX) into `data/raw/`.

### Step 2: Preprocess

```bash
python src/preprocess.py
```

Loads the raw data, cleans out outliers and duplicates, handles missing values dynamically, normalizes strings, splits dataset using stratified sampling, and target-encodes categorical variables.

### Step 3: Train

```bash
python src/train.py
```

Performs Optuna hyperparameter optimization for LightGBM and XGBoost, performs a final fit with early stopping, trains a Ridge baseline, runs Leave-One-Material-Out CV (LOMO-CV), and saves the trained models and training results.

### Step 4: Evaluate

```bash
python src/evaluate.py
```

Generates 10 performance, residual, distribution, learning curve, and SHAP plots, and outputs consolidated metrics.

### Step 5 (optional): Predict on new catalysts

```bash
python src/predict.py --input my_candidates.csv --bootstrap_n 100
```

Predicts HER for each row in the input CSV and computes bootstrap confidence intervals.

## Dataset

The master dataset contains **886 entries** of glycerol photoreforming
experiments mined from published literature. Each entry includes catalyst
composition, synthesis conditions, light source parameters, and the reported
hydrogen evolution rate (HER).

> **Note:** The raw dataset is gitignored because it may contain unpublished
> research data. Add it locally to `data/raw/` before running the pipeline.

## Data Quality
- `data_quality_flag`: OK = verified; NEEDS_REVIEW = plausible but unverified; LIKELY_ERROR = confirmed duplicate or impossible value — all LIKELY_ERROR rows are dropped before training.
- Duplicate `experiment_hash` rows are deduplicated by keeping the row with the highest `metadata_completeness_score`.
- Confidence columns weight each row during training: HIGH=1.0, MEDIUM=0.7, LOW=0.3.
- **Primary generalization metric in the paper is LOMO-CV R²** (leave-one-material-out), not random CV R², because TiO₂ comprises 72% of the dataset.

## Model

| Aspect | Detail |
|---|---|
| Algorithms | XGBoost, LightGBM, Ridge |
| Validation | 5-fold cross-validation & LOMO-CV |
| Target | log₁₊ₓ(HER) — log-transformed to handle skewed distribution |
| Metrics | R² (log and original scale), MAE (µmol g⁻¹ h⁻¹), RMSE |
| Explainability | SHAP TreeExplainer |

## Results

Results will be populated after training. Run `python run_all.py`.
